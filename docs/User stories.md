# As a user I would like to be able to:

* have a visual representation of the game and its progress;
* create one or several games;
* start one or several games;
* join the game;
* play the game together with 1, 2, 3 people (up to 4 people in total);
* roll the dice and make a move according to rules (only when it is my turn to roll the dice and move a piece only if it is already in the game or if I had gotten 1 or 6 with the dice roll);
* have a possibility to end the game with the win of one of the players (according to rules, when all of the playerâ€™s pieces achieved the goal; first player with all pieces in goal wins);
